The conference will be held 7-9 December, 2009 during the Light Festival (http://www.lumieres.lyon.fr/lumieres/sections/en). *More than 4 millions visitors are expected in Lyon during the Light Festival (from December 5 to 8). No need to tell that hotel rooms are booked quite in advance. We strongly recommend JVRC attendees to make a reservation before September 30, 2009. After that date, there is no guarantee to find an hotel room available. See the web server for more details. * Note that applications for late-breaking Laboratory Presentations and Demonstrations remain open through 30 September; see the web site for submission instructions. Exhibition booths may still be purchased as well. We look forward to seeing you in Lyon! JVRC09 Organizing Committee
