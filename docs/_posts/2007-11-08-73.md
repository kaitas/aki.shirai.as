Eurographics Virtual Environments 2008 (EGVE'08) Symposium

[http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/EGVE/cfp.html](http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/EGVE/cfp.html)

Call for Participation

We invite you to participate in the Eurographics Virtual Environments  
(EGVE) symposium in Eindhoven, Netherlands, May 29-30th, 2008 which is  
co-located with EuroVis. EGVE is an international symposium for the  
exchange of experience and knowledge among researchers and developers  
concerned with using and improving virtual environments. EGVE 08 will  
provide an opportunity for virtual reality researchers to interact,  
share new results, show live demonstrations of their work, and discuss  
emerging directions for the field.

Call for papers

Original, unpublished papers documenting new research contributions,  
practice and experience, or novel applications, from all areas of  
virtual environments, are invited. The best full-length papers will be  
invited to extend their work and publish in the Computer & Graphics  
ournal. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Interaction techniques for VR  
- Tracking & Sensing  
- Immersive projection technologies  
- Haptics, audio and multimodal interfaces  
- VR system architecture and development  
- 3D input and output devices  
- Augmented and mixed reality (AR and MR)  
- Collaborative and distributed VR  
- User studies and evaluation  
- Presence and cognition  
- Interactive rendering, modeling and simulation  
- VR, AR, and MR applications

Important dates

14th January 2008 : full and short paper submission  
17th March 2008 : decisions to authors  
17th April 2008 : camera-ready version due
