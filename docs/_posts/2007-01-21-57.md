Recently, I am trying to use <span style="font-weight: bold;">FoxLingo Add-ons</span> on FireFox.  
[https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2444/](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2444/)   
I haven't know there are such a lot of translating free service on the net.  
Of course, it is not a perfect but it might be better than nothing on my international blog...  

[For example...](http://ocn.amikai.com/amiweb/browser.jsp?url=http://ameblo.jp/akihiko/&display=2&langpair=ja%2Cen&c_id=ocn&lang=JA&toolbar=yes)  

I will compare some engines and try to find my best one to translate from Japanese to English.  
(Also there is a Japanese to French engine.)  
When I write such a auto translated post, I will add [auto] on the title.  
I am sorry for my laziness but computer life should be laziness.  
Maybe the title will be hand translated. :-)
