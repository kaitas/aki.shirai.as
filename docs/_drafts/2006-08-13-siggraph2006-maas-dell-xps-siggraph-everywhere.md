Maa is my new French friend who had met at AF332 which is going to SIGGRAPH 2006 Boston.  
We had shown a lot of things in the plane each other.  
Especially, I had been excited about his DELL XPS. It has a hologram mono eye and color and frequency of LEDs can be controlled by his 3D real time graphics program...  

So, this is a first trial to submit my original Video Blog to YouTube...  
I will try to submit same one on Ameblo, a famous Japanease blog service.  
It will be [here](http://ameblo.jp/akihiko/entry-10015698096.html).  
I expect the responses will be different about this.
