In this year, I have to get accept some articles on international conference and journals.  

In the past days, I had managed them on my Wiki site, but I guess such as CFP(Call For Paper/Participation) should be posted to Blog like here.  
[http://akihiko.shirai.as/modules/bwiki/index.php?CallForPapers](http://akihiko.shirai.as/modules/bwiki/index.php?CallForPapers)

Now, there are too many international conferences about Entertainment Technologies.  
But their qualities of conference (submission, management, difficulty and publicity) are completely different.

So, it looks like a vogue.  
I know such as situation is just typical "Research of Play" in medieval to modern generation.

Someone says,  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Research of Play is Playing of Researcher, isn't it?"</span>

I am not sure it will be true or not, but I think it will be a hint archiving CFP linked to Entertainment Technologies.  
Also it will be a good memorandum for my research....
