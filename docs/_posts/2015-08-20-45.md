# IVRC2015 final call for your great project!!

Dear all, The 23rd International collegiate Virtual Reality Contest (IVRC) welcomes you to submit your innovative work to the worldwide competition of novel interactive projects. The contest has more than twenty years history and several past winners of the contest have been accepted by the world’s most notable competitions of interactive technologies such as ACM SIGGRAPH Emerging Technologies, Laval Virtual Revolutions, and Ars Electronica. Your work will be reviewed based on the submitted materials including demonstration video. The previously demonstrated work is also acceptable. If your project is accepted, we will offer you a live demonstration space in the final competition held with [Digital Contents Expo](http://dcexpo.jp) 2015 in Tokyo from Oct. 24 to Oct. 25, 2015. **International Video Submission Deadline is Aug. 31, 2015.** For detailed information, please refer to [http://ivrc.net/2015/en/video/](http://ivrc.net/2015/en/video/) If you have a question, please feel free to ask us: ivrcinfo@ivrc.net We are eagerly waiting for your innovation and passion! Best, IVRC executive committee, Virtual Reality Society of Japan ivrcinfo@ivrc.net

So, here is invited project and review of IVRC award in Laval Virtual Virtual Fantasy.

## Stimulus

ESIEA Ouest, Laval, France https://youtu.be/Tl0TR759l1Q

### [Description]

Our project is a universal and low-cost simulator designed for home that can simulate any virtual environment. Our project is a 2DOF simulator that is easily transportable and storable due to its standard dimensions (70cm-square, by 30cm of height), allowing it to go through classic doors. With this platform, you can simulate for example a car race, a flight simulation or even a ski immersion. Finally, it costs less than 400$. Our demonstration consists on simulating a miner trolley sliding along a roller-coaster into an old mine. The user is seated at the middle of the structure, which moves around 2 axis (pitch and roll), carry on by two Wipper-motors. These can reproduce most movements from the virtual world seen by the user. Then, an impression of speed is created by a fan, which pulses air according to the trolley’s speed, and an air pressure system which simulates some collisions into the virtual world.

### [Jury comment]

“History repeats itself”, through evaluating Japanese and French VR student contest for many years, it is possible to feel keenly the repetition of the history of VR. HMD vogue comes after 3D mode. I have not betrayed stimulus, feel thing comes later than them. The student contest “Virtual Fantasy Category ” in this year of Laval Virtual, the exhibition had 14 student works gathered from France and Canada. They are touching to VR from visual, art, interaction, and various other fields such as sports. So, proposed and characterized projects have focused to “VR which appeal to the senses”. Specifically, cart simulator that feel without looking at the eyes, horse carriage to operate with string tensions, robot action operating in more than one player, HMD visual art that presents a visual effect, athletic using the Kinect, AR toy which is played by a tablet and a miniature garden… Growing imagination and its realization average, product ability of the next generation is very interesting. [Laval Virtual 2015 Virtual Fantasy Category “DEMO”](http://www.laval-virtual.org/en/prices-competitions/virtual-fantasy/demos-2015.html) On the other hand, new element called “sensation” is cumbersome, it should not only making a novel hardware. How to transmitted to the sense to the player? How to establish in an easy-to-understand interaction? What should be the interaction meaningful with a technical rationality? How it can presented stable system is a wide range of people? Such difficult elements to maintain a balance of understanding to people. Specifically, “The ideas is wonderful, however the sensor is unstable” or, “Stimulus is presented but very rough”, it is very far from the state experience to taste it. We are agree for such a rough student work, but we have considered to an international level of entire work in review. Project “Stimulus”, at first glance, it might look like ordinary-looking classic roller coaster by motion platform thanks to HMD by a player who haven’t experienced it. First, the concept is a “home use general-purpose VR simulator.” Its exterior, such as a crate has been designed for home. Important techniques and implementation are exist under of it. Actuator expression are only two axes inclination. The design is simple but its force is stable are strong. In fact, its made by recycled auto parts. Low possibility of failure, low chance of children accident. Drive power is also a reuse of PC parts. It will withstand the exhibition in each country. For situations of roller coaster, it is not required excessive interaction. Current system can provide a great experience to wide range of players by reliable 2-axis actuators with realtime 3D graphics. The secret, was a dedicated controller software for controlling two wiper motors. Other proposed 13 projects in Laval Virtual Virtual Fantasy have various weaknesses or some disappointing, Stimulus proposed their challenge as “home for the motion platform, $ 400 or less”, polite manufacturing has get win. We expects their further development of this unique work for IVRC final exhibition at DCEXPO (Oct. 24th and 25th) in Miraikan, Tokyo Japan. IVRC Award in Laval Virtual 2015, Jury Committee
