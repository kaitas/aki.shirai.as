<span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:85%;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;" lang="EN-US">On Wednesday 30 May 2007,  

Representatives from all the active EU Projects investigating the various aspects of Presence research will gather in <st1:city st="on"><st1:place st="on">Pisa</st1:place></st1:city> for a day-long scientific event (PASION, IMMERSENCE, PRESENCCIA, IPCITY, PEACH).  

On Thursday 31 May 2007,  

<u>PERCRO will held 1 day of tutorials and presentations dedicated to the XVR technology.</u>  

“XVR is a free development framework for complex VR application. It was used at PERCRO in the past 9 years for a variety of projects dealing with real-time graphics and interaction, and it is continuously updated to accommodate always-evolving programming needs. Thanks to its ease of use and flexibility XVR is today used by several research institution around the world offering a wide range of useful and practical functionality to control the many aspects linked to VR programming, including real-time graphics, sound, interaction, cluster rendering (CAVE), and support to the most common VR devices (trackers, displays, haptics and interaction devices).”  

Both the event are free and open to everyone interested. For schedule, travel information and hotel info please see here:
