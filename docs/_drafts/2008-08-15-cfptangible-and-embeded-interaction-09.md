<div style="">----------------------------------------------------------------------</div>

<div style="">Computing is progressively moving beyond the desktop into new physical and social contexts. One key area of innovation has been around tangible computing, which pushes the user interface beyond the digital into the physical world. This includes work on tangible interfaces, graspable interfaces, physical computing, and interactive surfaces. A closely related topic is that of embedded interaction where the everyday objects and environments we interact with are computationally augmented in new ways. Designing such systems requires interdisciplinary thinking. Their creation must not only encompass software, electronics, and mechanics, but also the system's physical form and behaviour, as well as its social impacts.</div>

<div style="">After the big success of TEI'07 and TEI'08 we are pleased to announce the third international conference dedicated to presenting the latest results in tangible and embedded interaction. We invite submissions of work addressing HCI issues, design, user experience, tools and technologies, as well as interactive art in the broad area of tangible computing and embedded interactive systems. The intimate size of this single-track conference provides a unique forum for exchange of ideas through talks, interactive exhibits, demos, posters, art installations and performances. All accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings, which will be published through the ACM Digital Library.</div>

<div style="">----------------------------------------------------------------------</div>

<div style="">TOPICS FOR SUBMISSION</div>

<div style="">Authors are invited to submit high-quality original work to advance the field. Appropriate topics include but are not limited to:</div>

<div style="">* Examples of novel tangible interfaces or embedded interactive systems</div>

<div style="">* Case studies and evaluations of working deployments</div>

<div style="">* Relation of tangible and embedded interaction to other paradigms</div>

<div style="">* Programming paradigms and tools, toolkits, software architectures</div>

<div style="">* Novel enabling technologies</div>

<div style="">* Interactive uses of sensors and actuators, and electronics and mechatronics</div>

<div style="">* Design guidelines and methods</div>

<div style="">* Applied design in the form of concept sketches, prototypes and products</div>

<div style="">* Novel applications</div>

<div style="">* Theoretical foundations, frameworks, and concepts</div>

<div style="">* Philosophical, ethical and social implications</div>

<div style="">* Usability</div>

<div style="">* Provocative design work and interactive art</div>

<div style="">----------------------------------------------------------------------</div>

<div style="">SUBMISSION DETAILS</div>

<div style="">Authors are invited to submit papers that are 2, 4, 6 or 8 pages long, formatted to follow the two column ACM SIGCHI format. We are happy to consider a variety of styles for inclusion in the proceedings, such as academic papers, design sketches and descriptions of art pieces or installations. All accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings, which will be published through the ACM Digital Library.</div>

<div style="">At the time of submission, authors will be able to specify their preferred format for presenting the work, which includes:</div>

<div style="">* 15 minute talk</div>

<div style="">* 5 minute talk</div>

<div style="">* Poster</div>

<div style="">* Interactive demo</div>

<div style="">* Exhibit</div>

<div style="">* Installation</div>

<div style="">We anticipate a large volume of submissions this year, but the timeslots available for talks (and space available for demos and exhibits) will be limited by necessity. In order to be help the program committee to include as much interesting work as possible, authors will also be able to specify whether they would be happy to present their work in a format other than their preferred format.</div>

<div style="">Submissions will be peer reviewed in a double-blind process: please anonymize your submission. In case of acceptance, at least one author must register before the early registration deadline for the conference in order for the final paper version to be published in the conference proceedings.</div>
