[FujiSankei Business i. 2005/11/18](http://www.business-i.jp/news/top-page/topic/200511180004o.nwc)  

<span style="font-style: italic;">Sony released a new music player "Walkman A" at 19th November, then they start a promotion performance that installs dancers on a wall of Shibuya Station and they dance during 50 hours.</span>  

<span style="font-style: italic;">This promotion focuses to the stamina of new "Walkman A" that can play during 50 hours or more. Total 50 dancers are prepared and each dancer changes every 30 minutes.</span>  

If the producer could find other specification on the new walkman, he will not do such as stupid advertise. Because, I cannot see the new walkman on the picture!!  
So, I hope no dancers will dies or catch a cold in this event...too cold, isn't it?
