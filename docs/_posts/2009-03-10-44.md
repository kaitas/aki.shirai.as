MindTrekなる学会がフィンランドで開催されるらしい。 チュートリアルやワークショップなどもあり、けっこう大規模。 ============================================================================ ========= ACM Academic MindTrek 2009: Everyday Life in the Ubiquitous Era Call for Papers, Tutorials and Workshops September 30th -- 2nd October, 2009 Tampere, Finland http://www.mindtrek.org, http://www.mindtrek.org/academic In cooperation with ACM, ACM SIGMM and ACM SIGCHI publications will be published in the ACM digital library and a selected set of high-level contributions will published as book chapters or in journals ============================================================================ ========= Academic MindTrek 2009 Call for Papers, Tutorials and Workshops We are pleased to invite you to the Academic MindTrek conference from September 30th -- 2nd October, which brings together a cross-disciplinary crowd of people to investigate current and emerging topics of media in the ubiquitous arena. Media to be discussed range from business, social and technical to content-related topics. September 30th is the main Academic day, featuring the following three tracks: * Social Media Social media and Web 2.0 technologies are applied in ever diverse practices both in private and public communities. Traditional communication and expression modalities are challenged and totally new practices are constructed in the collaborative, interactive media space; * Ambient and Ubiquitous Media “The medium is the message!” -- This conference track focuses on the definition of ambient and ubiquitous media with a cross-disciplinary viewpoint: ambient media between technology, art, and content. The focus of this track is on applications, theory, art-works, mixed reality concepts, the Web 3.0, and user experiences that make ubiquitous and ambient media tick; * Digital Games Digital play and games are currently undergoing many transformations: gaming devices are becoming truly connected, players are finding more possibilities for collaboration, and simultaneously games are being applied into novel uses and mobile use contexts. In addition, special academic sessions (e.g. tutorials, workshops, and multidisciplinary sessions) will be held on Oct 1st & 2nd, parallel to the MindTrek business conference. Academic speakers and authors are warmly welcome to attend the business conference tracks as part of the academic conference fee during these days as well. The MindTrek Association hosts MindTrek as a yearly conference, where the Academic MindTrek conference has been a part of this unique set of events comprising competitions, world famous keynote speakers, plenary sessions, media festivals, and workshops since 1997\. It is a meeting place where experts and thinkers present results from their latest work regarding the development of Internet, interactive media, and the information society. MindTrek brings together researchers and practitioners from diverse disciplines that are involved in the development of media in various fields, ranging from sociology and the economy, to technology. The organizing committee invites you to submit original high quality full papers, long or short, addressing the special theme and the topics, for presentation at the conference and inclusion in the proceedings. We are interested in contributions in the topic areas social media, ambient/ubiquitous media, and games such as: - case-studies (successful, and especially unsuccessful ones) - oral presentation of fresh and innovative ideas - artistic installations and running system prototypes - user-experience studies and evaluations - technological novelties, evaluations, and solutions - scientific, business, or media oriented contributions - proposals for own workshops. Paper Proposals All submissions will be peer-reviewed double blinded, therefore please remove any information that could give an indication of the authorship. The scientific part of the conference is organized in cooperation with ACM SIGMM, and ‘ACM SIGCHI. Conference proceedings will be published in the ACM Digital Library. Selected high quality papers will be published in international journals, as book chapters, edited books, or via open access journals. There will also be a reward for the overall best paper from the academic conference. Workshop Proposals Feel free to suggest workshops which are co-organized with MindTrek 2009. Workshop proposals should include the organizing committee, a 1 page description of the theme of the workshop, a short CV of organizers, duration, the proceedings publisher, and the schedule. Workshop organizers also have the possibility to add publications to the main conference proceedings. Tutorial Proposals Tutorial proposals should include a 2-page description of the tutorial, intended audience, a short CV, timetable, required equipment, references, and a track record of previous tutorials.
