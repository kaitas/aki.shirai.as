Our ability to convey complex meaning and emotion by the clever arrangement  
of symbols and signs is one of the most celebrated aspects of our human  
heritage. If Aesthetics is defined as the interaction between symbol and  
observer within a social context, then Computational Aesthetics is the  
empirically based field that examines applications of Aesthetics.  
Computational Aesthetics integrates aspects of computer science, psychology,  
and the visual arts, with particular focus on the mathematical and  
information theoretic aspects of symbol processing by humans and computers.  
By combining insights from these fields, Computational Aesthetics not only  
provides tools for the graphics and visualization communities to increase  
the value of displayed imagery and to avoid classical artifacts, but also  
furthers our understanding of perception and meaning. Computer based tools,  
resulting from Computational Aesthetics research, may also be used to  
enhance the expressive power of the fine and applied arts and to expand the  
role of aesthetic design as a differentiating factor in product development  
and retail sales.  
We are pleased to announce the third workshop on Computational Aesthetics,  
which will take place in Banff, Alberta, Canada. This conference will bring  
together individuals with technical backgrounds who are developing computer  
based tools to solve aesthetic problems and people with artistic and design  
backgrounds who use these new tools in their work. Invited talks will be  
given by leading technical and artistic/design figures to help participants  
to better understand what computer technology is capable of delivering and  
to fully appreciate what is involved in the artistic and design process.  
Refereed papers will also be presented to provide a snapshot of the latest  
technical breakthroughs and the most recent artistic or design achievements  
in applying computer based techniques to solve aesthetic problems. The  
overriding goal of the conference will be to facilitate a dialogue between  
the scientists and engineers who are creating these new tools and the  
artists and designers who are the end users.

Submissions are invited across the broad range of areas covered by  
Computational Aesthetics. Specific examples include, but are not limited to:

a.. Artistic Image Transformation Techniques (colors, edges, patterns,  
dithering)  
b.. Image Analogies, Style Transfer Methods  
c.. Sketching, Simplification techniques (artistic, cognitive)  
d.. Composition, Visual Balance, Layout  
e.. Non-Photorealistic Rendering  
f.. Image Style Analysis (Paintings, Photographs, others)  
g.. Empirically based Metrics of Aesthetical Attributes  
h.. Applied Visual Perception (Color Appearance, Spatial Vision, and other  
aspects)  
Submitted papers should be original, unpublished work of up to 8 pages. The  
manuscripts must be written in English. For details on the submission  
guidelines please refer to the paper submission page. Best papers will be  
encouraged to submit a journal version to a special issue of IEEE CG&A.

Note that this call for technical contributions is complemented by a call  
for participation by experts in the visual arts.

Download this call for papers as a TXT file or a PDF file.
