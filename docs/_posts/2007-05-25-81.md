SAMD 2007: Spatial Audio for Mobile Devices  
http://www.samd.nus.edu.sg/  

Workshop in conjunction with MobileHCI, September 9 2007, Singapore  
http://www.mobilehci2007.org  

Call for Position Papers (2-4 pp)  
Deadline: June 30, 2007  
Notification: July 20, 2007  
Workshop: September 09, 2007  

Submit to: samd2007 at mixedrealitylab.org  

As the world and its population move towards ubiquity, high tech mobile devices continuously decrease in size, leaving users to interact with small screens. Thus the user would face difficulty in finding ways to interact with such interfaces, and the efficiency may be reduced of his/her PDA or mobile phone. By combining interaction with visual audio, the user interface of the mobile device can be enhanced to provide the user with more comfort and ease for navigation or interaction with the device.  

The goal of this workshop is the promotion of spatial sound with mobile devices to enhance user interaction with such devices. It will bring together experts and practitioners from diverse and related fields, exchanging ideas, interests, research studies, exposing participants to different views and perspectives in the field of mobile human interaction with spatial sound.  

Topics of interest explored within this one-day workshop will primarily focus on spatial sound and development of small screen interfaces. Topics include, but are not limited to:  

• Spatial sound as an interaction element in minimal attention interfaces  
• Spatial sound in mobile HCI  
• Auditory displays in mobile & ubiquitous user interaction  
• Spatial sound for mobile users with visual disabilities  
• Sound in social navigation  
• Sound in mobile games  
• Mobile, ubiquitous and tangible HCI in music performance  
• Mobile HCI and music composition  
• Spontaneous music, mobility, and audio sharing  
• Mobile collaborative and distributed composition  
• Mobile digital technology in music education  
• Multimodal integration (visual, auditory, and haptic)  

Researchers and developers that want to contribute to a vivid discussion leading to spatial audio for mobile devices are invited to submit a maximum 4 pages position paper in the ACM template format ( http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html), on above relevant topic for the workshop, including challenges and solutions for the development of spatial sound on small screen displays devices. Submissions should be e-mailed as a PDF attachment on or before June 30, 2007 to samd2007 at mixedrealitylab.org. Please see http://www.samd.nus.edu.sg/ for further details.
