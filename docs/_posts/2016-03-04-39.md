# **VRIC 2016 Final Programme**

**Wednesday, March 23 – 10am to 5pm (Diocèse Main Room)** **International speakers present their vision of the future of new technologies and the first draft of the "Laval Virtual Vision" for Technologies & New Uses. "Round Tables" bring together industrialists and scientists to exchange their visions and needs for the next 10 years. [<u>Register!</u>](http://www.laval-virtual.org/en/scientific-conferences/vric/registration-access.html)** **10h** **Official Opening** Dr. Simon Richir, Arts et Metiers ParisTech, Laval Virtual Scientific Director **10h10** **Beyond Fun and Games: VR as a Tool of the Trade** Dr. Carolina Cruz Neira & Dirk Reiners Emerging Analytics Center, University of Arkansas at Little Rock, U.S.A. VR technology is much more than goggles, there are many ways to build devices and systems to immerse users in virtual environments. There are also a lot of challenges in aspects related to creating engaging, effective, and safe VR applications. This talk will present our experiences in developing VR technology, creating applications in many industry fields, exploring the effect of VR exposure to users, and experimenting with different immersive interaction models. Carolina Cruz-Neira is a pioneer in virtual reality, known for being the co-inventor and developer of the CAVE virtual reality system, for developing several of the most used VR APIs and for creating large-scale research centers focused on VR technology and applications.   **10h45 The Expected Impact of Light-Field Technology for Augmented Reality** Dr. Oliver Bimber, Institute of Computer Graphic, Johannes Kepler Univ Linz   Light fields have the potential to revolutionize everything we related to imaging and display technology today — including Augmented Reality. As a four dimensional scene representation, they are more powerful than 3D, and less complex than a 5D plenoptic representation. Modern approaches in optics, material science, and computer science are leading light fields to fundamentally new applications that go far beyond computational photography. Augmented Reality & Light-Field Technology expert, Bimber's research interests include visual computing and optics in the context of next-generation display and imaging technologies. **11h20 Coffee break** **11h45** **Beyond Video Games: A Virtual Reality Revolution in Behavioral Health** Dr. Skip Rizzo, Institute for Creative Technologies Two decades of research on Clinical VR now stands poised to drive the availability of scientifically informed therapeutic consumer products. From VR systems designed to treat Phobias and PTSD to Virtual Human role play systems for teaching social and job interview skills to persons on the autism spectrum, VR will have a significant impact on the future of behavioral healthcare. Psychologist Skip Rizzo conducts research on the design, development and evaluation of virtual reality (VR) systems targeting the areas of clinical assessment, treatment rehabilitation and resilience. Rizzo is working with a team that is creating artificially intelligent virtual patients that clinicians can use to practice skills required for challenging clinical interviews and diagnostic assessments. **12h20** **The Future of Work with Augmented Reality** Christine Perey, AR for Enterprise Alliance In the future Augmented Reality-assisted systems will improve many aspects of the workplace. Dynamically organizing systems with 5G networks, head-mounted optical see-through display devices and a variety of networked objects and sensors, will offer a range of new possibilities. For those who perform tasks involving the manipulation of physical world objects, the suite of technologies will increase productivity and safety while at the same time reducing errors and costs. Christine Perey is a spime wrangler and evangelist. She came to this conclusion after nearly two decades as a consultant, analyst and advisor to companies, young and old. She wrangles spimes in cyberspace from her balcony over Lake Geneva in Montreux, Switzerland. **13h00 VRIC Lunch (Diocèse Refectory)** Lunch provided on site, included in the registration fee. **14h00** **The vision and the needs of industry on future uses of virtual technologies** Round table and debate, exchanges with the audience with Alexandre Godin, Ergonomist & Technologist @**Airbus Emerging Technologies and Concepts** Georges Karvelis, Président @**Sintax Transport** France moderated by Simon Richir & Marc Pallot, Arts et Metiers ParisTech **14h45  ****How VR & AR technologies are going to change the World?
