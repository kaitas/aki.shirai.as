I had found interesting project, "[modulobe](http://www.modulobe.com/)" by Prof. Koichiro Eto, when I seek current real time physics simulator states.  

Our [Springhead](http://springhead.info/) also support such as artificial life but looks cool.  

They have website, wiki and community on mixi.  
And they are exhibiting at NTT ICC museum until 25th December.  
(and ICC will be shut soon!)

When register your character file to their wiki, you can see them on ICC!
