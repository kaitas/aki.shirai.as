So, why such as same topic conferences make same deadlines...  
I have interests for all.. probably CHI Canada is best for me.  
However, if I submit my research result now, who will pay for me...?  
Of course, it's a sort of brake of research but sometime it makes troubles...  
(My grant patron will be change at Jan.)
