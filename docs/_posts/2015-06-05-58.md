<pre>try to keep indents for each lines
if you just type
   it is very difficult to read
     so it is harder for you 
     else if it is not hard to read for you
   it may take more time to understand 
   and it is also hard to someone else 
    like teachers or yourself, 
      a month later, you may forget your source
even if you just copy and paste from google results,
  if you try to make indents, 
    you may understand it better.
then you need to make indents.

Here is an example :-)</pre>
