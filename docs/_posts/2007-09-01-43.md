■"Exertion Interfaces",Florence, Italyと"Evaluating User Experiences in  
Games"ワークショップ、というCHIらしいCFPを2件まとめて紹介します。ゲーム  
評価はやはりイタリアは"熱いトピック"なのでしょうか、興味深いです。

Call for papers: "Exertion Interfaces" workshop at CHI 2008, Florence, Italy

Exertion Interfaces are interfaces that deliberately require intense  
physical effort. They can be expected to be physically exhausting when  
used for an extended period of time, and are therefore working in the  
opposite direction of most conventional interfaces that aim for ease of  
use and efficient operation. However, recent research has shown that  
physical, exhausting interfaces can be beneficial for fighting personal  
weight problems, encouraging social interaction between participants and  
allowing for new gaming experiences.

This one-day CHI'08 workshop builds on the successful CHI'07 workshop,  
which was the first forum to share information among researchers  
interested in the area of Exertion Interfaces. Similar to last year, we  
will influence and be influenced by emerging trends in this fast-paced  
area, but this year, the focus will be on a multidisciplinary approach  
to Exertion Interfaces through learning from related domains such as  
sport, medical science, gaming, coaching, social science, and education.  
This will allow us to broaden and deepen the areas of inquiry identified  
last year: theory, evaluation, tactics, training, skills, body  
expression, audiences, teams and new dimensions we identify through our  
Wiki until then.

One desired long-term outcome of the workshop is a co-edited book  
illuminating the domain from a diverse set of perspectives as well as  
the organization of a symposium for next year, providing a dedicated  
forum for researchers of Exertion Interfaces.

How to participate:

Send a position paper of 3 pages max. to  
workshopCHI@exertioninterfaces.com describing your research interest and  
your relevant work in this area. It must be prepared in the Conference  
Extended Abstracts Format. Selection criteria will include participants'  
backgrounds and interests and quality of the work described in the  
position papers.

Note: At least one author of accepted papers needs to register for the  
workshop and for one day of the conference itself.

Important Dates:

3 Oct 2007, 5:00 PM (1700) PDT: Position papers due  
28 Nov 2007: Notification of acceptance.

Call for Papers: "Evaluating User Experiences in Games" workshop at CHI 2008

The workshop "Evaluating User Experiences in Games" invites position  
papers on evaluation methods for user experience in games. Submissions  
are invited addressing one or more of the following questions:

What kind of evaluation concepts and methods are used in the industry,  
and what are their limitations?

Do today's game evaluation concepts and methods address industry needs?

What factors of game experience are measured and have to be measured ?

How can we evaluate new forms and developments of interaction techniques  
in gaming – for example emotion or eye-movement as input for games,  
ambient displays or virtual environments as output?

Is there a common framework of methods that are appropriate to evaluate  
the user experience in games?

How to participate:

Submissions are expected in the form of 4 page position papers (ACM  
format), describing the area of research, specific work (empirical or  
theoretical) on the workshop topic and the innovative character of the

■「映画におけるヒューマン・ロボットインタラクション」という珍しいテー  
マ。"HINOKIO"なんかど真ん中なのかも。10月締め切り。

Call For Video Submissions

======================================  
Human Robot Interaction Caught On Film

======================================

The Human Robot Interaction 2008 conference will host a video session, in  
which movies of interesting, important, illustrative, or humorous HRI  
research moments will be shown. We invite videos related to all aspects of  
human-robot interaction. Robots and humans do not always behave as expected  
and the results can be entertaining and even enlightening - therefore  
instances of failures will also be considered. We invite all researchers in  
the HRI area to share their best videos that may have been taken  
accidentally or intentionally.

A panel of your peers will review video submissions, but will not follow a  
strict peer review procedure. Besides the importance of the lessons learned  
and the novelty of the situation, the entertainment value will be judged.  
The video session has the character of a design competition.

Each video must be accompanied by a 200-word abstract that describes the  
video. The video itself must be self-explanatory for the HRI-2008 conference  
audience. The use of voice-over, subtitles or introduction slides is  
recommended to prepare the audience for the video.

The selected videos will be published in the conference proceedings (CD-ROM)  
and in the ACM digital library. The authors of the selected videos should  
plan to attend the conference and will be given a moment to explain the  
video.

Submission  
==========

The video material should be of the highest available quality. The video  
should preferably not be scaled down or compressed. The preferred video  
format (codec) is standard DV in either the PAL or the NTSC standard. The  
video container may be AVI or Quicktime. The maximum length is 3 minutes.  
The length of the credits at the end is limited to three seconds.

Upload the videos to the FTP server at [ftp://home.bartneck.de](ftp://home.bartneck.de). The login is  
"hri2008" and the password "Videosaregreat1". Upload them to the directory  
"incoming". The filename should correspond to the name of the author, such  
as JohnDoe.avi. Alternatively, the author can put a video on a web site and  
submit the video's URL to christoph@bartneck.de.

The contact details for all authors, the abstract, the movie's title, a  
representative screenshot, and the filename of the submission must be  
submitted throught the conference submission system  
([http://www.precisionconference.com/~hri](http://www.precisionconference.com/~hri)). The screenshot should show a key  
scene of the movie and it should not contain text, such as in the credits or  
the opening title. The screenshot will be used for the edited paper.

The deadline for submission is September 10th, 2008\. The notice of  
acceptance will be send by December 7th, 2008\. Upon acceptance, the authors  
will have to submit an ACM release form. Authors' do not need to assign the  
copyright to ACM. In addition, the authors must have obtained permission of  
every relevant person in the movie for showing the video at the conference  
and for distributing the movie in the proceedings and in the ACM digital  
library. Alternatively, the people in the movie may be rendered anonymous by  
visual effects, such as blurring.

Submission Checklist  
--------------------

WORKSHOP: From HCI to Media Experience: Methodological Implications  
CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

WORKSHOP: From HCI to Media Experience: Methodological Implications

DATE: Tuesday, 4th September 2007  
WORKSHOP WEB SITE: [http://hcid.informatics.indiana.edu/experience/](http://hcid.informatics.indiana.edu/experience/)  
CONFERENCE: HCI 2007 Lancaster, UK  
CONFERENCE WEB SITE: [http://www.bcs-hci.org.uk/hci2007/](http://www.bcs-hci.org.uk/hci2007/)

WORKSHOP OVERVIEW  
The landscape of interactive technology design and evaluation is expanding.  
In the past, usability and task efficiency were the main focus for  
research in human computer interaction; evaluation methods worked from  
single user data over constrained tasks. This kind of work remains  
central to our discipline.  

However, these methods were never intended to inform or underpin the design  
and evaluation of media-rich, social technologies. They are not aimed at  
designing for quintessentially elusive concepts like ³experience² and  
³engagement². Especially when that experience is not individual, but social,  
where data and performance are spread across many people, platforms and  
devices, and many settings, and where the lab test cannot shed light on ways  
that experience unfolds over time.  

In this workshop we invite discussion of approaches and methods aimed at the  
design and measurement of interactive, social media experience. The workshop  
will center on approaches methods that are used in the design of short-term  
engagement and experience, but also those that are aimed at consideration of  
engagement and experience over longer durations - from watching a 3-minute,  
socially tagged video online, to massively multiplayer games like World of  
Warcraft that take months to unfold, to plug-ins for social networking sites  
like Facebook, to social simulations like Second Life, to social and  
community media-archiving projects. What do these emerging experiences tell  
us about the methods we currently use, and the methods we need to develop?

WHO SHOULD ATTEND  
For this workshop, we invite contributions from a diverse range of  
disciplines, including HCI, design, cultural studies, cognitive science,  
psychology, film and media studies, game studies, and anthropology, among  
others, to explore how interactions with technology become experiences, and  
in particular, social and/or intimate experiences.  

Participants are to explore questions such as the following:  

* What is an experience?  

* What are the ways in which qualitative and quantitative measures can weave  
together?  

* How can we operationalize critical categories into nuanced yet verifiable  
scientific methods?  

* How do we make sense of data that are gathered into meaningful reflections  
of people's experience?  

* What skills are needed for "experience design"?

The workshop will be a full-day event and will be open to a maximum of 15  
participants. Please note that registration to the HCI2007 conference is  
required, at least for the day of the workshop. For details about conference  
registration, please visit [http://www.bcs-hci.org.uk/hci2007](http://www.bcs-hci.org.uk/hci2007)  
<[http://www.bcs-hci.org.uk/hci2007](http://www.bcs-hci.org.uk/hci2007)>

WORKSHOP FORMAT  
This is a full-day workshop. The morning session will consist of short  
presentations and discussion of participants' position papers ­ where  
participants will be asked to raise questions that are central to their  
current work in designing and evaluating experiences. Participants will be  
encouraged to bring examples of their work, or of others¹ work that has  
either eluded analysis from traditional methods, or has inspired the  
development of new methods of design and analysis that more effectively  
reflect people¹s experiences. We encourage participants to think broadly,  
from games to fairground rides to immersive learning contexts to  
psychotherapeutic environments ­ any experiences that can inform approaches  
that lead to deeper understanding of online and embodied media experience.

In the afternoon session, participants will break into small groups  
depending on their main interest and discuss topics. At the end of the  
workshop, the small groups will report back, which will form the basis for a  
plenary discussion.

CALL FOR POSITION PAPERS

Advances in cognitive neuroscience and brain imaging technologies  
provide us with the increasing ability to interface directly with  
activity in the brain. Researchers have begun to use these technologies  
to build brain-computer interfaces, in which patients with severe motor  
disabilities can communicate and control devices with thought alone.  
Although removing the need for motor movements in computer interfaces is  
challenging and rewarding, we believe that the full potential of brain  
sensing technologies as an input mechanism lies in the extremely rich  
information it could provide about the state of the user. Having access  
to this state information is valuable to human-computer interaction  
(HCI) researchers and opens up at least three distinct areas of  
research: controlling computers with thought alone, evaluating systems  
and interfaces, and building adaptive user interfaces. Although this is  
not the focus of this workshop, we will consider accepting a small  
number of position papers proposing methods of using techniques such as  
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to send information directly to  
the brain.

Specifically, this workshop aims to identify and discuss:

* brain-computer interface applications for users with permanent and  
situational physical disabilities, as well as for able-bodied users.  
This includes application in domains such as traditional communication  
and productivity tasks, as well as games and entertainment computing;

* sensing technologies and data processing techniques that apply well to  
the suite of applications in which HCI researchers are interested;

* techniques for integrating brain activity, whether induced by thought  
or by performing a task, in the palette of input modalities for  
(multimodal) human-computer interaction;

* interesting problems that need more work, especially in areas that are  
unique to HCI applications

We encourage participation from a wide range of disciplines including  
Neuroscience, Cognitive Psychology, Human-Computer Interaction,  
Affective Computing, and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning. The  
workshop will be limited to 18 participants. Please submit a 2-4-page  
position paper outlining your interest in this topic to  
anijholt@cs.utwente.nl. Position papers must be received by 3 October,  
2007\. Participants will be notified of selection by 28 November 2007\.  
The workshop date is 5 April 2008\. CHI workshops are only open to people  
who have had their position paper accepted by the workshop organizers,  
and who have registered for the workshop and at least one day of the  
conference itself.
