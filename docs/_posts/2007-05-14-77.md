*** AIMS AND SCOPE ***  

Mixed Reality (MR) and Augmented Reality (AR) allow the creation of  
fascinating new types of user interfaces, and are beginning to show  
significant impact on industry and society. The field is highly  
interdisciplinary, bringing together signal processing, computer vision,  
computer graphics, user interfaces, human factors, wearable computing,  
mobile computing, computer networks, displays, sensors, to name just some  
of the most important influences. MR/AR concepts are applicable to a wide  
range of applications.  

Since 1998, ISMAR and its forerunner events have been the premier forums in  
this vital field ([http://www.augmented-reality.org/iwar/](http://www.augmented-reality.org/iwar/)). This year we are proud to  
present the 6th IEEE and ACM International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented  
Reality (ISMAR 2007). The symposium will be held on Nov. 13-16, 2007, in  
historical Nara, Japan. We invite you all to participate in this great  
event for the exchange of new ideas in this exciting field!
