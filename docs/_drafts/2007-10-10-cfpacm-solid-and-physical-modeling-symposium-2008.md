---------------------------------------------------

ACM Solid and Physical Modeling Symposium 2008 (SPM'08) will be held  
on June 2-4, 2008, in Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York,  
USA.

This highly successful conference series have been a primary venue for  
disseminating research results and exchanging new ideas in geometric  
and solid modeling, physical modeling, geometric design, analysis,  
simulation and processing, shape computing and visualization, and  
various applications. SPM'08 will be immediately followed by the  
International Conference on Shape Modeling and Applications 2008  
(SMI'08), to be held in Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York,  
USA, on June 4-6, 2008\. Both SPM'08 and SMI'08 events will be  
co-located in Stony Brook University, and are parts of the 2008 Stony  
Brook Modeling Week that features International Joint Convention on  
Shapes and Solids (ICSS'08).

Selected papers of outstanding quality accepted at SPM08 will be  
published in: IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer  
Graphics, IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,  
Computer Aided Design, and Computer Aided Geometric Design. SPM08 Best  
Paper Award is sponsored by Siemens UGS.
