"fallen", someone who is killed by war. The Fallen of World War II https://vimeo.com/128373915 It can be counted as a pixel, but it may have another aspects. During watching this well edited visualization, I've thought a lot of things. I can believe video games save fallen from the world war in this new peace. But I also think again killed people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and urban attacks. http://www.aasc.ucla.edu/cab/200708230009.html We are children of children who is attacked people, but who is still alive. This piece can also gave me a point of view from Chinese children who is attacked by Japanese solders. And remember here are some nationality who is lost in the history. We should share the history again, not only from an individual view. To understand each other, to find next new world together. Thanks Paul Debevec​ for sharing this, and Neil Halloran. http://www.fallen.io/ww2/
