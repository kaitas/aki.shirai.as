It is a web questionnaire. After see a few pictures, select your best one for each answers.  
That's all!  
It will be closed in this weekend if I got enough count of data.  

I thank you in advance to forward this mail.Especially, I need a lot of "normal" subjects like your family instead of CG researchers.  

best regards,
