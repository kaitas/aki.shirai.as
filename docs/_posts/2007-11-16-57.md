Today I developed a building block of Virtools4 for Tokin Motion Sensor (MDP-A3U9S). It can capture acceleration, gyro and magnetic field on the earth. In this demo, I can see the North pole through "North" value. http://www.youtube.com/v/z4bcx-khBAo You can download the source code from my website. http://akihiko.shirai.as/modules/mydownloads/viewcat.php?cid=5
