I'm sorry for my long absent...  

I had back from SIGGRAPH2006 Boston.  
Then I will write something about it.  

Especially, I had written an article for Weekly Famitsu, a most famous weekly game magazine in Japan.  
I have a small column that named as "Look for the future games!".  

This article will be sold at 25th August 2006 on the store (Issue:8thSep).
