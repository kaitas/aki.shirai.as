Bonjour,

Today I checked the new online submission system of SIGGRAPH2008.

-Indicate whether your presentation will differ in some way from the

Unable to upload final imagery yet due to copyright restrictions  
-Provide as much detail as possible, but remember that the jury will  
evaluate your work based solely on the uploaded materials, so you must

-Check here to request review by the English Review Service.  
Non-native English speakers may use the English Review Service to help  
with text of submissions. Please note that this takes time, so your  
submission must be sent to the English Review Service well in advance of  
the published deadline.

The next page is a agreement of rights no changes as before.

Anyway, it sounds difficult for past challengers but it makes a lot of  
chance for newcommers, I think!

best regards,
