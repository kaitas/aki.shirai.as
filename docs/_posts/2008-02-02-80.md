Dear colleagues of VR and interactive techniques,

The submission deadline of Laval Virtual ReVolution, the world  
competition of VR demonstrations, was past at 1st Febrary 2008.

We would like to say great thanks to your submitted projects. However,  
unfortunately, we had some other important deadlines in parallel.

We held the 10th anniversary of Laval Virtual in this year. To honor our  
"invited acceptance" (it includes your international flight tickets,  
accommodation and gala dinner tickets at the old castle), we need more  
great number of submissions and quality.

If you already have submitted your project, you got a chance to improve  
the submission with the latest state of arts and/or special approach for  
Laval Virtual.

If your project have not started your submission, you should register
