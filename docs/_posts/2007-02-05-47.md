<span style="font-weight: bold;">Laval Virtual ReVolution 2007</span>  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">-World Performance of VR Applications-</span>  

Laval Virtual ReVolution is an annual honor to the world’s finest VR project, by Laval Virtual. This is a hall of fame award that decides the best Virtual Reality demonstration and/or application from all over the world. Virtual Reality is not only a technology but also a never ending story between computers and human history.  

We cannot get the final answer of this issue immediately, as we still need to find and walk one of the many possible paths that will lead us to a future navigated by brilliant stars. The staring at those stars should be continued for the future voyagers on the way.  

Of course, a great number of academic papers or commercial products can build a way of Virtual Reality. However we suggest a new relation between developmental projects and general public at on-site demonstrations. If a performed project has impact, technology and is persuasive, it will move the general public and change the common sense. So, this means a revolution in the history of Virtual Reality.  

Please try to join today's stardom with your exciting project.  
And share the activity from all over the world!
