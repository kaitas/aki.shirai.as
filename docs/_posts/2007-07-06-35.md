Bonjour a tous,  
Hello everyone,  

I am sorry to make a long sleep on this blog.  

At 8th June, my 2nd son "Lucas" has come to my home!

(click to visit his special website!)  

"Lucas", it pronounces as "RUKA" in french.  
It works in Japanese (it may sounds a girl's name but possible).  
In English, he will be called as "Lu-ka-su" like Georges LUCAS ;-)  
Saint Lucas is a patron of Artist and Doctors.  
And now he is French nationality (Japanese nationality will be get soon.)  
Anyway I hope he becomes an international child.  

So, now I have a lot of experiences about baby sitting with IT...  
It is a good chance to enlarge my knowledges for mothers...!
