<span style="font-weight: bold;">FDS:Flying Disk System. It's a "specification" of the PSP first version. You can shoot UMD when you play a game.</span>  

It also my reason why I haven't get PSP...  
Today I found a funny movie about this issue.

The golf game said "Nice Shot!" but... :-)  

You can see other movies, whew... I also found PSP playable...

Do you know the current PSP have this "function"? :-)
